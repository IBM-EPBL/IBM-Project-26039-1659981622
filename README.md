#ABOUT PROJECT

Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive
information such as login credentials or account information by sending as a
reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels.
Phishing attacks can paralyze a business. Staff might be unable to continue
their work. Data and assets might be stolen or damaged. Customers might
be unable to access online services. The reason security defenders struggle
to detect phishing domains is because of the unique part of the website
domain.
